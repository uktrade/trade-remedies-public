            <p>We’re always looking to improve the accessibility of this service. If you find any problems

            <p>In England and Wales, the Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) is responsible for enforcing the

                'accessibility regulations'). If you're not happy with how we respond to your complaint, contact the

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Technical information about this service’s accessibility</h2>
            <p>The {% organisation_name %} is committed to making this service accessible, in accordance with the Public
                Sector Bodies (Websites and Mobile Applications) (No. 2) Accessibility Regulations 2018.</p>
            <h3 class="heading-small">Compliance status</h3>
            <p>The website is partially compliant with
                <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1 AA standard</a>.</p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">Non-accessible content</h2>
            <p>The content listed below is non-accessible for the following reasons.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Non compliance with the accessibility regulations</h3>
            <ol class="govuk-list govuk-list--number">
                <li>Information and relationships that are implied by visual or auditory formatting are not preserved
                    when the presentation format changes.This fails 1.3.1. success criterion. </li>
                <li>There is not enough contrast between text and its background so that it can be read by people with
                    moderately low vision (who do not use contrast-enhancing assistive technology). This fails WCAG 1.4.3
                    success criterion.</li>
                <li>Images on some pages do not always have suitable image descriptions. Users of assistive technologies
                    may not be given information conveyed in images. This fails WCAG 2.1 success criterion (Non-text Content).</li>
                <li>Not all text can be resized without assistive technology up to 200 percent without loss of content or
                    functionality. This fails WCAG 1.4.4 success criterion.</li>
                <li>Some content is not operable with a keyboard without needing specific timings for individual keystrokes.
                    This fails WCAG 2.1.1 success criterion.</li>
                <li>Where users are navigating sequentially through content they don’t always get information in an order
                    that is understandable  and can be operated from the keyboard. This can be confusing as users can’t
                    form a consistent mental model of the content. This fails WCAG 2.4.3 success criterion.</li>
                <li>The purpose of every link cannot be understood from the link text alone so users can decide whether to
                    follow the link. This fails WCAG 2.4.4 success criterion.</li>
                <li>The keyboard does not have a mode where the user can always see which part of the page the keyboard will
                    interact with. People with attention limitations, short term memory limitations, or limitations in
                    executive processes benefit by being able to discover where the focus is. This fails WCAG 2.4.7 success
                    criterion. </li>
                <li>The application does not automatically identify and describe an input error so that users are aware that
                    an error has occurred and can determine what is wrong.  This fails WCAG 3.1.1 success criterion.</li>
                <li>Labels or instructions are missing where content requires user input so that users know exactly what is
                    expected from them or in the case of radio buttons, checkboxes or similar, users know what they have
                    selected. This fails WCAG 3.2.2. success criterion. </li>
                <li>Start and end tags are missing meaning that screen readers won’t be able to accurately parse and
                    interpret content. This fails WCAG 4.1.1 success criterion. </li>
                <li>Where custom controls are created, measures have not been taken to ensure that the controls can be
                    controlled by assistive technology. This fails WCAG 4.3.2 successes criterion. </li>
                <li>Many documents are in less accessible formats, for example PDF. </li>
            </ol>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Disproportionate burden</h3>
            <p>We believe that fixing the accessibility problems with some content would be disproportionate because the
                relevant platform will be replaced soon.</p>

            <h3 class="heading-small">Content that’s not within the scope of the accessibility regulations</h3>
            <p>Non-HTML documents published before September 2018 do not need to be accessible - unless users need them
                to use a service. </p>

            <h2 class="heading-medium">What we’re doing to improve accessibility</h2>
            <p>We are fixing content which fails to meet the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines version 2.1. We will
                update this page when issues are fixed.</p>
